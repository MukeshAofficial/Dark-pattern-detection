# Dark-pattern-detection

**Problem Statement:**
In the realm of e-commerce, the proliferation of deceptive design techniques, commonly known as dark patterns, poses a significant challenge. Users frequently encounter manipulative interfaces that steer them towards unintended actions, resulting in compromised decision-making and diminished user trust. Recognizing and mitigating the impact of dark patterns on the user experience is imperative for fostering transparency and ethical practices in the e-commerce landscape.

**Approach:**
To address the pervasive issue of dark patterns in e-commerce, our approach involves the systematic collection of user interaction data within digital platforms. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying and predicting instances of dark patterns. The model will be trained on diverse patterns extracted from real-world scenarios, allowing it to discern subtle nuances and evolving tactics employed by deceptive interfaces. The predictive insights generated by the model will empower us to proactively counteract dark patterns, thereby enhancing user autonomy, fostering trust, and promoting a more ethical e-commerce environment.
